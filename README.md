## Laravel with Voyager

What is Voyager https://voyager-docs.devdojo.com/

Before installing Voyager it is very important to take a quick moment to learn what it is & what it isn't.
What it is
An admin interface for your Laravel app
An easy way to add/edit/delete data for your app
A menu builder (build menus in Voyager for your app)
A media manager for your files
CRUD/BREAD generator (<a href="https://voyager-docs.devdojo.com/bread/introduction">bread/introduction</a>)
Voyager is simply an admin for your Laravel app. Whatever you want your app to do on the front-end is completely up to you. You are in control of your application and you can use Voyager to make your life easier by adding data, editing users, creating menus, and many other administrative tasks.
What it isn't
A content management system (CMS)
A blogging platform
Wordpress (Bleh! ðŸ˜œ)
Voyager is not a CMS or a blogging platform. But it can be used to create a CMS or a blogging platform, but out of the box it is neither of those. As stated in the previous section you have full control on what your application will do and how it will function.
With Laravel & Voyager you can create any kind of application your heart desires. Laravel & Voyager are simply tools to make it easier to build.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
